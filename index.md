    <h2>Current Position</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently a researcher at the <b>University of Arkansas, Fayetteville</b>,
      working in the <b>Monroe Molecular Simulation Group</b> led by Prof. Jacob Monroe.
      My work focuses on <b>probabilistic coarse-grained → atomistic backmapping</b>
      using generative models with rigorous reweighting to recover correct
      thermodynamic ensembles.

    <h2>Research Trajectory</h2>
    <p>
      Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at <b>Texas A&amp;M University</b>
      in the Mittal Group, studying protein–DNA interactions and chromatin compaction.
      Before that, in the <b>Thirumalai Group</b> at <b>UT Austin</b>, I worked on
      optimized force fields for intrinsically disordered proteins such as FUS,
      with implications for neurodegenerative disease.
    </p>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Foundations</h2>
    <p>
      My doctoral research with Prof. Valeria Molinero at the <b>University of Utah</b>
      focused on nanoparticle self-assembly, nucleation, and polymorph selection of
      porous materials, providing a strong foundation in statistical mechanics and
      materials modeling.

    <h2>Global Perspective</h2>
    <p>
      Earlier training at <b>IISER Pune</b> and research experiences in Germany
      (University of Saarbrücken) and the UK (University of Surrey) shaped my
      interdisciplinary and global approach to computational science.
